# Sprint 7: Admin Auth + Metabolic Insights Deployment

## Summary

🔒 **Critical security vulnerability fixed** + full metabolic insights feature deployed to staging and production databases.

**Ready for Vercel staging deployment and validation testing.**

---

## Changes Included

### 1. ✅ Database Migrations (Already Deployed to Staging + Production)

**Metabolic Insights Tables (11 tables):**
- food_entries, food_photos, food_ingredients
- glucose_readings, glucose_predictions
- personal_models, meal_templates, metabolic_insights
- subscription_tiers, feature_flags, analytics_events

**RLS Policies (40 total):**
- 36 table-level policies (multi-tenant isolation)
- 4 storage-level policies (path-based access)

**Storage Buckets:**
- food-photos bucket (PUBLIC for OpenAI Vision API)
- Max file size: 5MB
- Allowed types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp

### 2. 🔒 Admin Authentication Security Fix (CRITICAL)

**Previous Implementation (INSECURE):**
- ❌ feature-flags: `return true;` (anyone was admin)
- ❌ metrics: Header-based auth (`x-admin: 1` bypass)
- ❌ tokens: Header-based auth (`x-admin: 1` bypass)

**Current Implementation (SECURE):**
- ✅ Database-backed verification via `admin_users` table
- ✅ RLS policies prevent enumeration attacks
- ✅ Only service role can modify admin_users
- ✅ Centralized `isAdmin()` function in lib/auth.ts
- ✅ Consistent error responses (403 Forbidden)

**Test Admin User:**
- Staging: testaccount@evermed.ai (user_id: e67f5219-6157-43e7-b9ce-c684924a5ed6)
- Production: testaccount@evermed.ai (user_id: d5d91bec-957b-46e4-adba-b1b7af7e4434)

### 3. 📝 Documentation

**New Documentation:**
- `docs/ADMIN_AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_2025-10-12.md` (10KB security analysis)
- `docs/SPRINT_7_DAY_1_COMPLETION_2025-10-12.md` (deployment log)
- `docs/METABOLIC_INSIGHTS_STATUS_2025-10-12.md` (feature status)
- `docs/metabolic-insights-sprint-7-8-finalization.md` (sprint plan)

**Memory Updates:**
- All deployment blockers resolved
- All critical issues resolved
- Sprint 7 Day 1-2 marked complete

- `apps/web/src/app/api/admin/usage/tokens/route.ts` - Database auth
- `db/schema.prisma` - Added AdminUser model

### Database Changes (2 files)

- `db/schema.prisma` - AdminUser model added

### Documentation (4 new files + 2 updated)
- New: Implementation docs, deployment logs, sprint plans
- Updated: Memory files (active-issues.md, project-state.md)

## Security Impact

### Vulnerabilities Fixed ✅
1. ✅ Admin endpoint placeholder auth (anyone could access)
2. ✅ Header injection attack (`x-admin: 1` bypass)
3. ✅ Enumeration attack (RLS prevents discovering admins)
4. ✅ Privilege escalation (only service role can modify)

### Attack Vectors Mitigated
- Header-based authentication removed
- Database verification required
- Fail-closed error handling
- RLS enforcement at database level

---

## Testing Requirements

### Pre-Merge Validation ✅
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: PASSED
- ✅ ESLint: PASSED (50+ warnings acceptable)
- ✅ Build: PASSED (51 routes built)
- ⚠️ Tests: 1 pre-existing failure (not related to changes)

### Post-Deploy Validation (Required)
1. **Admin Authentication**
   - [ ] Login as testaccount@evermed.ai
   - [ ] Access /admin dashboard
   - [ ] Test GET /api/admin/metrics (should return 200)
   - [ ] Test GET /api/admin/feature-flags (should return 200)
   - [ ] Test GET /api/admin/usage/tokens (should return 200)
   - [ ] Logout and verify non-admin gets 403

2. **Metabolic Insights**
   - [ ] Test food photo upload
   - [ ] Verify OpenAI Vision API analysis works
   - [ ] Check metabolic dashboard loads
   - [ ] Verify glucose readings display
   - [ ] Test meal entry creation

3. **Database Verification**
   - [ ] Confirm 11 metabolic tables exist
   - [ ] Verify 40 RLS policies applied
   - [ ] Check food-photos bucket accessible
   - [ ] Verify admin_users table has testaccount

## Deployment Notes

### Database Status
- ✅ Migrations applied to staging (2025-10-12)
- ✅ Migrations applied to production (2025-10-12)
- ✅ Storage buckets created in both environments
- ✅ RLS policies active in both environments
- ✅ Test admin user configured in both environments

### Vercel Deployment
- Merging this PR will trigger Vercel staging deployment
- After validation, merge staging → main for production

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Revert code: `git revert <commit-hash>`
2. Emergency admin access: Update `isAdmin()` to allow all authenticated users (temporary)
3. Database rollback not needed (migrations already applied successfully)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Merge this PR** → Triggers Vercel staging deployment
2. **Run validation tests** (checklist above)
3. **Fix any issues found** in staging
4. **Merge staging → main** for production deployment
5. **Monitor** admin endpoint access and metabolic feature usage
