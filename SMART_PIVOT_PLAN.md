# EverMed Glucose Tracking Focus - Smart Simplification Pivot Plan

**Strategy**: Option B - Keep working metabolic code, delete health vault only
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks to production
**Decision Made**: 2025-10-15
**Execution Status**: ✅ Code Pivot Complete

---

## Executive Summary

**What We're Doing:**
- ✅ KEEP: Metabolic Insights (85% complete, working in dev)
- ❌ DELETE: Health Vault (documents, chat, share packs)
- ✅ KEEP NAME: EverMed (no rebranding needed)
- 🚀 DEPLOY: Staging this week, production week 2-3

**Why This Makes Sense:**
- Metabolic code is the focused glucose tracker we want (photo → nutrition → glucose prediction)
- Throwing away 85%-complete working code = 2-3 month delay
- Market validation requires USERS, not perfect architecture
- We can simplify further based on real usage data
- EverMed name works for glucose tracking - no rebranding needed

**Key Insight:**
> "The metabolic insights feature you already built is the focused glucose tracker. Deploy it, learn from users, then optimize based on data."

## Comparison: Smart Pivot vs Original Pivot

| Aspect | Original Destructive Pivot | Smart Simplification Pivot |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Strategy** | Delete all, rebuild from scratch | Delete health vault only |
| **Schema** | 6 tables | 13 tables (already implemented) |
| **Code Reuse** | 15% | 85% |
| **Timeline** | 2-3 months | 2-3 weeks |
| **Risk** | High (unproven assumptions) | Low (proven working code) |
| **User Validation** | After 3 months of development | After 1 week of development |
| **Gemini AI** | Rebuild integration | Keep working integration |
| **LSTM Predictions** | Rebuild from scratch | Already scaffolded |
| **Dashboard UI** | Rebuild Material Design | Keep working Material Design |
| **Apple Health** | Priority 1 (blocking) | Priority 2 (add if users want) |

**Winner**: Smart Simplification (faster time to user feedback)

- 30+ meals logged per day
- Error rate <2%
- User satisfaction >4.0/5.0
- Identify feature usage patterns

---

## Decision Points (Data-Driven Simplification)

After 1 week of beta usage, analyze data:

### High Usage → Keep
- `meal_templates` used by >30% → KEEP
- `metabolic_insights` checked daily → KEEP
- `glucose_predictions` drive engagement → KEEP

### Low Usage → Delete
- `meal_templates` used by <10% → DROP table
- `metabolic_insights` never opened → DROP table
- `personal_models` LSTM unused → DROP and simplify to baseline

### User Requests → Prioritize
- Top request: Apple Health sync → Add in Week 4
- Top request: Faster analysis → Optimize Gemini
- Top request: Something unexpected → Adapt plan

**This is how we avoid rebuilding for months based on assumptions.**

## Deployment Blockers (From Previous Analysis)

### ⚠️ Must Fix Before Staging

**1. Admin Authentication** (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: `isAdmin()` returns `true` (placeholder)
- **Risk**: Admin endpoints publicly accessible
- **Fix**: Check `admin_users` table in RLS query
- **Time**: 2 hours
- **File**: `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`

**2. Storage Buckets** (HIGH)
- **Issue**: `food-photos` and `ml-models` buckets don't exist in staging/prod
- **Risk**: Photo uploads will fail
- **Fix**: Run `./scripts/setup-food-photos-bucket.sh staging`
- **Time**: 30 minutes

**3. Environment Variables** (HIGH)
- **Issue**: Staging Vercel missing API keys
- **Required**:
  - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`
  - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON`
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Time**: 15 minutes

### 🔶 Nice to Have (Post-Launch)

**4. LSTM Model Integration** (MEDIUM)
- **Status**: Using mock baseline predictor
- **Impact**: Predictions less accurate
- **Can Launch Without**: Yes (communicate "improving daily")
- **Time**: 3-5 days
- **Priority**: Week 4-5 (after user validation)

**5. Background Workers** (MEDIUM)
- **Status**: AI analysis blocks API response
- **Impact**: 15-25 sec delay in user feedback
- **Can Launch With**: Yes (add loading states)
- **Time**: 2-3 weeks
- **Priority**: Week 6-8 (performance optimization)

---

## Rollback Plan

If the pivot causes critical issues:

1. **Database Rollback**:
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   psql $DATABASE_URL < backups/backup_before_glucolens_pivot_*.sql
   ```

2. **Code Rollback**:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD~5  # Revert last 5 commits
   git push origin dev --force
   ```

3. **Partial Rollback** (keep deletion, revert branding):
   ```bash
   git revert <rebrand-commit-hash>
   # Re-add health vault routes temporarily
   ```

**Backup Location**: `backups/backup_before_glucolens_pivot_*.sql`

---

## Files Created for This Pivot

1. **`migrations/20251015_glucolens_smart_pivot.sql`** - Surgical database migration
2. **`scripts/smart-pivot-execution.sh`** - Automated execution script

## Next Steps

**Immediate (Today)**:
1. Review this plan for any concerns
2. Run: `./scripts/smart-pivot-execution.sh`
3. Review git changes
4. Commit: "pivot: delete health vault, keep metabolic features"

**This Week**:
5. Complete rebranding (EverMed → GlucoLens)
6. Fix admin authentication
7. Deploy to staging
8. Smoke test thoroughly

**Next Week**:
9. Recruit beta users
