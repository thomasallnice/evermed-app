# Step-by-Step: Get Vercel Bypass Token

Follow these exact steps to get the correct bypass token for automated testing.

---

## Step 1: Open Vercel Dashboard

1. Open your browser
2. Navigate to: **https://vercel.com/thomasallnices-projects/evermed-app**
3. You should see your EverMed project dashboard

---

## Step 2: Go to Settings

1. In the top navigation bar, click **"Settings"**
2. You'll see a sidebar with multiple options

---

## Step 3: Find Deployment Protection

1. In the left sidebar, look for **"Deployment Protection"**
2. Click on **"Deployment Protection"**
3. You should now see the Deployment Protection settings page

---

## Step 4: Locate "Protection Bypass for Automation"

Scroll down on the Deployment Protection page until you find a section titled:

**"Protection Bypass for Automation"** or **"Bypass for Automation"**

This section should have:
- A description explaining it's for automated tools
- A button to create/generate a token
- Possibly a list of existing tokens (if you've created them before)

---

## Step 5: Generate the Token

### Option A: If you see "Create Token" or "Generate Token" button
1. Click the button
2. A token will be generated
3. **COPY THE TOKEN IMMEDIATELY** (you'll only see it once!)
4. The token should look like: `bypass_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
5. Paste it here in our chat

### Option B: If you see existing tokens
1. Look for an existing token in the list
2. Click "Copy" or "Show" next to the token
3. Copy the full token value
4. Paste it here in our chat

### Option C: If you don't see this section at all
This means either:
- Deployment Protection is not enabled
- Your Vercel plan doesn't support bypass tokens (requires Pro/Enterprise)
- The feature is in a different location

**Let me know if this happens, and we'll try a different approach!**

---

## Step 6: What to Look For

The correct bypass token should:
- ‚úÖ Start with `bypass_`
- ‚úÖ Be a long random string (usually 20-30 characters)
- ‚úÖ Look like: `bypass_abc123def456ghi789`

**NOT like:**
- ‚ùå Short password-like tokens
- ‚ùå Tokens without `bypass_` prefix
- ‚ùå API tokens or service tokens

---

## Step 7: Provide the Token

Once you have the token:

1. **DO NOT** paste it in .env yourself
2. **PASTE IT HERE** in the chat
3. I will:
   - Validate it's the correct format
   - Add it to .env
   - Update .env.example
   - Re-run the deployment validation

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see Deployment Protection in Settings"

**Solution:** Enable Deployment Protection first:
1. Go to: Settings ‚Üí General
2. Find "Deployment Protection"
3. Enable it with your preferred method (Password, Vercel Authentication, etc.)
4. Then go to Settings ‚Üí Deployment Protection

### "I don't see 'Protection Bypass for Automation'"

**Possible reasons:**
1. **Vercel plan limitation** - Bypass tokens may require Pro plan
   - Check your plan at: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Plan
   - Upgrade if needed, or contact Vercel support

2. **Feature location changed** - Vercel UI updates frequently
   - Look for "Automation" or "Bypass" keywords in Settings
   - Check under "Integrations" or "API" sections

3. **Alternative approach** - Use Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   vercel env pull
   vercel env add VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET
   ```

### "The token I copied doesn't start with bypass_"

**Solution:** You may have copied the wrong token. Double-check:
- Are you in "Deployment Protection" settings?
- Are you in the "Protection Bypass for Automation" section?
- Is the token for **automation/testing** (not API access)?

---

## Next Steps

Once you paste the correct token here, I will:

1. ‚úÖ Validate token format
2. ‚úÖ Update .env with correct token
3. ‚úÖ Re-run deployment-validator subagent
4. ‚úÖ Generate comprehensive validation report
5. ‚úÖ Provide production readiness verdict
