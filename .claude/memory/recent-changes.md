## 2025-01-10: Schema Drift Prevention System

### What Was Done
Implemented comprehensive schema drift prevention system to prevent deployment failures.

### Changes Made
1. **Created validation scripts**:
   - `scripts/validate-migrations.sh` - Check migration status
   - `scripts/validate-schema-compatibility.ts` - Validate schema compatibility

2. **Updated CI/CD**:
   - Added `validate-schema` job to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - Runs before build-and-test job
   - Validates on dev, staging, main branches

3. **Added npm scripts**:
   - `npm run validate:migrations` - Check migration status
   - `npm run validate:schema` - Check schema compatibility
   - `npm run validate:all` - Run all validations
   - `npm run predeploy` - Auto-validation hook

4. **Created comprehensive documentation**:
   - `docs/TYPE_SAFETY_GUIDE.md` - Best practices for type safety
   - `docs/MIGRATION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Migration workflow
   - `docs/SCHEMA_DRIFT_PREVENTION_SUMMARY.md` - System overview

### Why This Matters
- Prevents deploying code before migrations applied
- Catches schema drift at CI time, not deployment time
- Enforces type safety between database and TypeScript
- Provides clear remediation paths

### Impact
- ✅ Schema issues now caught in <1 minute
- ✅ Clear error messages with fix instructions
- ✅ Automated validation on every push
- ✅ No more surprise deployment failures

## 2025-01-10: Stubbed Metabolic Endpoints

### What Was Done
Temporarily stubbed metabolic insights endpoints for staging deployment.

### Endpoints Stubbed
- `/api/analytics/correlation` - Returns empty meal impact data
- `/api/analytics/timeline/daily` - Returns empty glucose/meal timeline
- `/api/metabolic/food` - Returns 503 Service Unavailable
- `/api/predictions/glucose` - Returns 503 Service Unavailable

### Why
FoodEntry, GlucoseReading, and MLModel tables don't exist in staging database yet. Code expects these tables, causing TypeScript build failures.

### Next Steps
1. Apply metabolic insights migrations to staging
2. Re-enable endpoints by reverting stubs
3. Validate with deployment-validator agent

## 2025-01-10: Fixed Schema Compatibility Issues

### What Was Done
Fixed AnalyticsEvent schema mismatch issues.

### Changes Made
1. Changed from hardcoded types to Prisma-generated types:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   type AnalyticsEvent = { eventName: string; sessionId: string; ... }

   // After
   type AnalyticsEvent = Prisma.AnalyticsEventGetPayload<{}>;
   ```

2. Created compatibility helpers for old vs new schema:
   ```typescript
   function getSessionId(e) { return e.sessionId || e.userId || ''; }
   function getEventName(e) { return e.eventName || e.name || ''; }
   function getMetadata(e) { return e.metadata || e.meta || {}; }
   ```

### Why
Staging database has old schema (userId, name, meta) but code expected new schema (sessionId, eventName, metadata).

## 2025-01-09: PWA Implementation

### What Was Done
Implemented Progressive Web App features for EverMed.

### Changes Made
1. Added manifest.json for installability
2. Implemented service worker for offline support
3. Added offline fallback page
4. Made app responsive and mobile-first
5. Added install prompts for iOS and Android

### Testing
- ✅ Installable on mobile devices
- ✅ Offline support working
- ✅ Service worker caching functional
- ✅ Screenshots captured for documentation

## Branching Strategy (IMPORTANT)

### Branch Workflow
```
dev → staging → main
```

- **dev**: Active development, feature work
- **staging**: QA/testing, preview environment
- **main**: Production releases only

### Deployment Flow
```
Feature Branch → dev (PR) → staging (merge) → main (merge)
```

**Always use this flow. Never push directly to main.**
