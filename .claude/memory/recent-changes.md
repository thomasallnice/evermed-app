## 2025-10-08: Vercel Deployment Configuration Fixes
**Type:** Bug Fix
**Branch:** refit/user-auth-onboarding
**Commits:** 23d6996, f888b8f, cf31abe

### What Changed
1. **Fixed monorepo paths** in `vercel.json`
   - Old: `buildCommand: cd app && ...` (wrong path)
   - New: `buildCommand: npm run build` with `outputDirectory: apps/web/.next`

2. **Removed conflicting functions pattern**
   - Manual pattern was conflicting with Next.js auto-detection
   - Let Next.js handle API route configuration

3. **Fixed ESLint flat config**
   - Added `.next/**` to ignores
   - Fixed 15,954 linting errors from build artifacts

### Why
- Old `infra/vercel.json` had pre-monorepo paths
- Deployment was failing with "routes-manifest.json not found"
- Next.js App Router auto-detects API routes

### Impact
- âœ… Vercel builds now succeed
- âœ… No more manual functions configuration needed
- âœ… Clean linting output

  - Colorful topic badges (blue/purple/orange/green)
- Mobile hamburger navigation component
- 44px minimum touch targets for all interactive elements
- Responsive grid layouts: 1 col mobile â†’ 2 tablet â†’ 3 desktop

## 2025-10-04: Critical Database Fixes
**Type:** Bug Fix
**Branch:** refit/user-auth-onboarding
**Migration:** 20251004173139_fix_critical_cascade_and_unique_issues

### What Changed
1. **Fixed DocChunk cascade deletion**
   - Added `onDelete: Cascade` to DocChunk â†’ Document relation
   - Users can now delete documents without foreign key errors

2. **Added Person.ownerId unique constraint**
   - Prevents duplicate Person records per user
   - Data integrity enforcement

### Why
- Users couldn't delete documents (cascade was missing)
- Person.ownerId uniqueness wasn't enforced at DB level

### Impact
- âœ… Document deletion works correctly
- âœ… Data integrity improved
- âœ… Production-ready database schema

---

## 2025-10-04: API Route Dynamic Rendering
**Type:** Bug Fix
**Branch:** refit/user-auth-onboarding
**Commits:** Multiple

### What Changed
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to 17 API routes
- All routes using `requireUserId` marked as dynamic

### Why
- Next.js 14 App Router tries to prerender API routes at build time
- Routes accessing `request.headers` must be marked as dynamic
- Build was failing with "couldn't be rendered statically" errors

### Routes Fixed
- `/api/observations`, `/api/chat`, `/api/documents/*`, etc.
- All routes with authentication

### Impact
- âœ… Vercel builds succeed
- âœ… API routes work correctly at runtime
- âœ… No static prerendering conflicts
