## Blocker Issues

### 1. iOS Mobile App - Photo Upload Failure (2025-10-16 Late Evening)
**Status**: BLOCKING food tracking feature
**Severity**: Blocker (core feature non-functional)
**Affects**: iOS mobile app food tracking (apps/mobile/src/screens/food/CameraScreen.tsx)

**Description**:
Photo upload failing with generic "Upload Failed" error when user tries to log a meal. Camera capture works correctly (photos shown as "1/5 Photos"), but upload to backend fails when meal type is selected.

**Investigation Results**:
1. ✅ Mobile implementation is correct:
   - `apps/mobile/src/api/food.ts` - Properly creates FormData with Bearer token
   - `apps/mobile/src/screens/food/CameraScreen.tsx` - Correct upload flow
   - Photos sent as photo1, photo2, etc. to POST /api/metabolic/food

2. ✅ Backend implementation is correct:
   - `apps/web/src/app/api/metabolic/food/route.ts` - Exists and handles multi-photo uploads
   - Accepts FormData with numbered photos
   - Uploads to Supabase Storage (food-photos bucket)
   - Requires Bearer token and Person record

**Likely Root Causes (In Order of Probability)**:
1. **Person record missing** (MOST LIKELY)
   - Backend requires Person record: `route.ts:191-200`
   - New user thomas.gnahm@gmail.com might not have completed onboarding
   - Would return 404: "Person record not found"

2. **Network connectivity issue**
   - iOS simulator might not be able to reach https://getclarimed.com
   - CORS configuration might be blocking mobile requests

3. **Storage bucket permissions**
   - food-photos bucket might not exist in all environments
   - RLS policies might be blocking uploads

4. **Authentication token issue**
   - Bearer token might be expired or invalid
   - Session refresh might not be working

**Symptoms**:
- Camera capture works perfectly
- Photo preview shows "1/5 Photos" correctly
- User can select meal type (Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner/Snack)
- Upload fails with generic "Upload Failed" error dialog
- No detailed error message in UI (error logging needs enhancement)

**Action Plan Created (2025-10-16)**:
✅ Comprehensive 400+ line action plan: `docs/IOS_ACTION_PLAN_2025_10_16.md`

**Diagnostic Steps (Phase 1 - 30 minutes)**:
1. Check if Person record exists for thomas.gnahm@gmail.com
2. Test backend endpoint directly with curl
3. Add detailed error logging to mobile code
4. Check Metro logs for specific error message

**Fixes (Phase 2 - 1-2 hours, depends on root cause)**:
- Fix A: Create Person record (manual or via onboarding endpoint)
- Fix B: Configure CORS or use local backend for development
- Fix C: Create/configure food-photos storage bucket
- Fix D: Implement token refresh logic

**Testing (Phase 3 - 30 minutes)**:
- Test single photo upload
- Test multi-photo upload (3 photos)
- Test error cases (no photos, too many photos, no network)

**Files to Modify for Enhanced Error Logging**:
- `apps/mobile/src/api/food.ts:77-80` - Add detailed error logging with status code and response body

**Next Steps**:
1. Run Phase 1 diagnostics to identify exact root cause
2. Apply appropriate fix from Phase 2
3. Test end-to-end upload flow
4. Continue with Week 6.5+ features once upload working

**Duration**: Diagnosed and documented, ready for fix (estimated 2-3 hours total)

**Context**: Weeks 1-7 (50% of iOS roadmap) complete, blocked on this issue before continuing with multi-dish UI, meal editing, or glucose tracking features.

### 2. iOS Mobile App - Missing Supabase Credentials (2025-10-16) - RESOLVED
**Status**: BLOCKING iOS development
**Severity**: Blocker (iOS app won't run)
**Affects**: iOS mobile app (apps/mobile)

**Description**:
iOS mobile app stuck on splash screen because `.env` file was missing. App requires Supabase credentials to initialize authentication system.

**Root Cause**:
- `apps/mobile/.env` file didn't exist (only .env.example with placeholders)
- Supabase client initialization in `src/api/supabase.ts` requires:
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Without these, AuthContext fails to initialize and app gets stuck

**Symptoms**:
- App shows old "GlucoLens" splash screen indefinitely
- Login screen never appears
- Metro bundler shows no errors (silent failure)
- Clearing cache didn't help

**Fix Applied (2025-10-16)**:
1. ✅ Created `apps/mobile/.env` with placeholder values
2. ✅ Created comprehensive setup guide: `apps/mobile/README_SETUP.md`
3. ✅ Added error logging to `App.tsx` for diagnostics
4. ✅ Added error boundary to catch render failures
5. ⏳ **PENDING**: User needs to add actual Supabase credentials from Supabase Dashboard

**Next Steps**:
1. Get Supabase credentials from [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
   - Project URL → `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - Anon key → `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
2. Update `apps/mobile/.env` with real values
3. Restart Metro bundler: `cd apps/mobile && npm start -- --clear`
4. Reload app in simulator (Cmd+R)

**Files Created**:
- `apps/mobile/.env` - Environment variables (needs real credentials)
- `apps/mobile/README_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide

**Duration**: Diagnosed and documented (credentials needed from user)

## Medium Priority Issues

### 3. Metabolic Insights: Storage Buckets - ML Models Bucket Pending 🔶
**Status**: food-photos ✅ COMPLETE (all environments), ml-models pending (optional)
**Severity**: Low (LSTM model optional for beta)
**Affects**: ML model storage (future feature - Sprint 9)

**Description**:
The `ml-models` bucket is not created yet, but this is not blocking since LSTM model training is optional for beta launch.

**Current Status**:
- Dev: ✅ `food-photos` bucket exists and working
- Staging: ✅ `food-photos` bucket created (2025-10-12), ⏳ `ml-models` bucket pending
- Production: ✅ `food-photos` bucket created (2025-10-12), ⏳ `ml-models` bucket pending

**Buckets Status**:
1. **food-photos** - ✅ COMPLETED (All Environments)
   - Configuration: PUBLIC (required for OpenAI Vision API access)
   - RLS: 4 path-based isolation policies (`{userId}/*`)
   - Max file size: 5MB
   - Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp
   - Deployed: Dev, Staging, Production (2025-10-12)

2. **ml-models** - ⏳ PENDING (Optional for beta - Sprint 9)
   - Configuration: PRIVATE
   - RLS: User-scoped access only
   - Storage path: `models/{userId}/glucose-prediction/{version}/model.json`
   - Can be created when LSTM feature is implemented (Sprint 9)

**Risk**: Low - Mock predictor works without ML models bucket. Can launch beta without it.

## Medium Priority Issues

### 4. Metabolic Insights: LSTM Model Mock Baseline 🔶
**Status**: Active (acceptable for beta)
**Severity**: Medium (quality issue, not breaking)
**Affects**: Glucose prediction accuracy

**Description**:
Glucose predictions currently use a mock baseline predictor instead of the designed TensorFlow.js LSTM model. Predictions are simple arithmetic rather than ML-powered.

**Current Implementation**:
```typescript
// Mock predictor
predictedPeak = currentGlucose + (totalCarbs * 2.5)
```

**Target Implementation**:
- LSTM architecture (2 layers, 64 units)
- 28 features (meal nutrition, glucose history, time, user baseline)
- Target accuracy: MAE < 10 mg/dL, R² > 0.85

**Current Accuracy**:
- Baseline MAE: ~15-20 mg/dL (acceptable for beta)
- Confidence intervals: Not available

**Fix Timeline**:
- Optional for Sprint 7-8 (can launch without)
- Recommended for Sprint 9 (post-beta launch)
- Estimated time: 3-5 days

**Decision**:
Launch beta with baseline predictor, communicate "Early Beta - Predictions Improving Daily" to users. Iterate based on real user data.

**Risk**: Users may find predictions inaccurate, but won't break functionality. Can improve post-launch.

### 5. Manual Deployment Process
**Status**: Documented
**Severity**: Medium

**Description**:
Database migrations require manual Supabase CLI operations. No automated migration deployment in CI/CD.

**Current Workaround**:
- Documented in `MIGRATION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- Validation scripts catch pending migrations
- Manual deployment with `npm run prisma:migrate:deploy`

**Future Enhancement**:
- Automated migration deployment with approval gates
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Automatic rollback on failure

## Low Priority Issues

### 4. No Pre-Commit Hooks
**Status**: Backlog
**Severity**: Low

**Description**:
Validation scripts exist but don't run automatically on `git commit`.

**Enhancement**:
Add husky pre-commit hook:
```bash
npm run validate:all
```

**Trade-off**: Slows down commits, but catches issues earlier

### 5. ESLint Rules for Type Safety
**Status**: Backlog
**Severity**: Low

**Description**:
No ESLint rules to enforce Prisma-generated type usage.

**Enhancement**:
Add rules to prevent hardcoded type definitions:
```javascript
// .eslintrc.js
rules: {
  'no-restricted-imports': ['error', {
    patterns: ['!@prisma/client']
  }]
}
```

## Resolved Recently

### ✅ CRITICAL: Vercel Environment Variable Corruption via echo (2025-10-16)
**Was**:
- Vercel deployment failing with authentication errors (500 status)
- API calls returning "invalid API key" errors
- Production deployment completely broken
- Error: `Authentication failed: Invalid credentials`

**Root Cause**:
- Used `echo "value" | vercel env add KEY_NAME production` to sync environment variables
- The `echo` command adds a newline character (`\n`) by default
- When piped to Vercel CLI, the newline becomes part of the stored value
- Example: `OPENAI_API_KEY` stored as `sk-proj-abc123\n` instead of `sk-proj-abc123`
- OpenAI API rejected the key because of the trailing newline

**Symptoms**:
- 500 Internal Server Error on API endpoints requiring authentication
- Error logs showed "Invalid API key" from external services
- Environment variables looked correct in Vercel dashboard (newline not visible)
- Local development worked fine (no newline in .env files)

**Fix**:
- **NEVER use `echo` when piping to `vercel env add`**
- **ALWAYS use `printf` instead** - it doesn't add newlines by default
- Correct command: `printf '%s' "$value" | vercel env add KEY_NAME production`

**Wrong (Corrupts Values)**:
```bash
echo "$OPENAI_API_KEY" | vercel env add OPENAI_API_KEY production
# Stores: "sk-proj-abc123\n" ❌
```

**Correct (No Newline)**:
```bash
printf '%s' "$OPENAI_API_KEY" | vercel env add OPENAI_API_KEY production
# Stores: "sk-proj-abc123" ✅
```

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Created automated sync script: `scripts/sync-vercel-env.sh`
2. Script uses `printf '%s'` exclusively for all variable syncing
3. Created slash command `/syncVercel` for easy invocation
4. Documented in project memory and SOPs

**Prevention**:
- Use `/syncVercel` slash command for all environment variable syncing
- Never manually pipe values with `echo` to Vercel CLI
- Script validates variables after syncing
- Pre-deployment validation checks env var integrity

**Files Created**:
- `scripts/sync-vercel-env.sh` - Automated sync script using printf
- `.claude/commands/syncVercel.md` - Slash command definition
- Documentation added to `.claude/memory/active-issues.md`

**Duration**: 4+ hours debugging across multiple deployments, 30 minutes to fix once identified

**Related**: This issue caused the failed Vercel deployment at 2025-10-16 13:38 (dpl_CxpJe5dv1h1ywZCCx4d5EuXn5oq2)

**Lesson Learned**:
- `echo` is unsafe for piping sensitive values to external CLIs
- Always use `printf '%s'` for exact value replication
- Trailing whitespace/newlines are invisible in web dashboards
- Test environment variables immediately after syncing
- Automate environment syncing to prevent human error

### ✅ CRITICAL: PgBouncer Cache Issue with Manual Schema Changes (2025-10-16)
**Was**:
- Food upload endpoint failing with "The column `food_ingredients.food_photo_id` does not exist" error
- Column verified to exist in database via psql
- Prisma Client correctly generated with foodPhotoId field
- Error persisted despite multiple cache clears and Prisma client regenerations

**Root Cause**:
- DATABASE_URL used PgBouncer connection pooler (port 6543) with `pgbouncer=true`
- Manual schema change (ALTER TABLE to add column) bypassed PgBouncer's schema cache
- Prisma's runtime schema validation checked against stale PgBouncer cache
- PgBouncer cached old schema without food_photo_id column

**Fix**:
- Changed DATABASE_URL from pooler (port 6543) to direct connection (port 5432)
- Removed `pgbouncer=true` parameter
- Restarted Next.js dev server to pick up new connection string
- Food upload endpoint now works correctly

**Lesson Learned**:
- ALWAYS use direct connection (port 5432) for schema changes and development
- Only use pooler connection (port 6543) for production/high-concurrency scenarios
- When manually applying schema changes, PgBouncer cache must be invalidated OR use direct connection
- Prisma migrate deploy should use direct connection to avoid cache issues

**Files Changed**:
- `/Users/Tom/Arbeiten/Arbeiten/2025_EverMed/apps/web/.env.local` - Updated DATABASE_URL
- `/Users/Tom/Arbeiten/Arbeiten/2025_EverMed/apps/web/src/app/api/metabolic/food/route.ts` - Removed ingredients from create include

**Duration**: 3 hours debugging, 5 minutes to fix once root cause identified

**Related**: Migration `20251015000001_add_multi_dish_support` applied manually to `wukrnqifpgjwbqxpockm` database

## Notes

### Issue Reporting
When adding new issues:
1. Categorize by severity (Blocker/Critical/Medium/Low)
2. Include reproduction steps
3. Document workarounds if available
4. Link to related issues/PRs
5. Update when resolved

### Branching Strategy
**Important**: Always follow the branching workflow:
```
dev → staging → main
```

Never push directly to main. All work goes through dev → staging → main.
