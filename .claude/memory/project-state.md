‚ö†Ô∏è **Metabolic Insights** - Migrations ready, pending staging deployment

## Git Branching Strategy & Environments

### Branch Workflow
```
dev (development) ‚Üí staging (preview) ‚Üí main (production)
```

### Environments Configuration

Each environment has its own Supabase project and configuration:

| Environment | Branch | Supabase Project ID | Config File | Vercel Branch |
|------------|--------|---------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Development** | `dev` | `wukrnqifpgjwbqxpockm` | `.env.local` | development |
| **Staging** | `staging` | `jwarorrwgpqrksrxmesx` | `.env.staging` | staging/preview |
| **Production** | `main` | `nqlxlkhbriqztkzwbdif` | `.env.production` | main/production |

### Environment Files
- **`.env.local`** - Local development (branch: dev)
- **`.env.staging`** - Staging/preview deployments
- **`.env.production`** - Production deployments
- **`.env`** - Currently used for local dev (same as development)

### Branch Purposes:
- **`dev`**: Active development branch
  - All feature work happens here
  - Merge feature branches to `dev`
  - Daily development workflow
  - Uses development Supabase project (wukrnqifpgjwbqxpockm)

- **`staging`**: Staging/preview environment
  - Merge `dev` to `staging` when ready for testing
  - Used for QA and validation
  - Auto-deploys to Vercel staging
  - Uses staging Supabase project (jwarorrwgpqrksrxmesx)
  - Test environment for integration testing

- **`main`**: Production branch
  - Merge `staging` to `main` for production releases
  - Auto-deploys to Vercel production
  - Protected branch (requires reviews)
  - Uses production Supabase project (nqlxlkhbriqztkzwbdif)

### Deployment Flow:
```
Feature Branch ‚Üí dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí main
     (PR)        (PR)   (merge)  (merge)
     |           |      |        |
     ‚Üì           ‚Üì      ‚Üì        ‚Üì
  (local)   (dev env) (staging) (production)
```

### Important Notes:
- **Never push directly to `main`** - Always go through staging
- **Schema migrations** must be applied to each environment's Supabase project BEFORE deploying code
- Run `npm run validate:all` before merging to any branch
- Tag production releases on `main` branch
- Each environment has separate API keys and database credentials

## Current Phase
- ‚úÖ Core Features Complete
- ‚úÖ PWA Implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Schema Drift Prevention: Implemented (2025-01-10)
- üîÑ Metabolic Insights: Migrations pending on staging
- üìã Next: Apply migrations to staging, re-enable endpoints

## Key Milestones Completed
- [x] Document vault & RAG implementation
- [x] Authentication & onboarding
- [x] Share packs with passcode protection
- [x] PWA features (manifest, service worker, offline)
- [x] Schema drift prevention system
- [x] Validation scripts and CI/CD gates
- [x] Comprehensive documentation

## Active Work
- Deploying PWA to staging
- Fixing schema drift issues
- Preparing metabolic insights for deployment

## Known Issues
- Metabolic insights migrations not yet applied to staging
- Some endpoints temporarily stubbed pending migrations
- AnalyticsEvent schema evolution in progress (old vs new fields)

## Next Steps
1. Apply metabolic insights migrations to staging database
2. Re-enable stubbed metabolic endpoints
3. Run deployment validation
4. Promote staging to production after validation

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for validation
- [ ] Schedule daily schema parity checks
- [ ] Implement ESLint rules for type safety
- [ ] Add blue-green deployment capability
