# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to EverMed.

Security and privacy are first-class. Please follow these rules for all changes:

- No diagnosis, dosing advice, emergency triage, or automated image grading (MVP nonâ€‘SaMD).
- Do not log PHI. Analytics payloads must be event-only, no free-text.
- Share links require: passcode, 7-day expiry, view logs, one-tap revoke (default ON).
- Use Supabase (DB/Auth/Storage/RLS), Vercel (hosting/env), GitHub (CI/CD).
- Never commit secrets. Use Vercel Project Env and Supabase secrets. `.env.local` is for local dev only and is gitignored.
- All storage buckets are private; access via signed URLs only.

## Development
