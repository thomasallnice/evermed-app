# Summary Table Migration - Validation Report

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Environment:** DEV (wukrnqifpgjwbqxpockm)
**Migration Type:** Manual SQL (Prisma migrations blocked)
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED & DEPLOYED

---

## Executive Summary

The Summary table migration has been successfully designed, validated, and deployed to the DEV environment. All validation tests passed, including schema integrity, RLS policies, foreign key constraints, and cascade behavior.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Summary table created with correct schema
- ✅ One-to-one relation to Document validated
- ✅ RLS policies applied and tested
- ✅ Cascade deletion verified
- ✅ Type casting issue resolved (auth.uid() → TEXT)
- ✅ Indexes created for optimal query performance

---

## Schema Design Review

### Summary Model (Prisma Schema)

```prisma
model Summary {
  id             String   @id @default(uuid())
  documentId     String   @unique
  userId         String?  // For RLS compatibility
  summaryText    String   @db.Text
  structuredJson Json?    // Structured summary output
  model          String   // AI model used (e.g., "gpt-5-mini")
  createdAt      DateTime @default(now())

  document       Document @relation(fields: [documentId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@index([userId])
}
```

### Design Validation

| Aspect | Assessment | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Relational Integrity** | ✅ APPROVED | One-to-one with Document via unique constraint |
| **Data Types** | ✅ APPROVED | TEXT for long-form content, JSONB for structured data |
| **Cascade Behavior** | ✅ APPROVED | CASCADE on DELETE and UPDATE prevents orphaned records |
| **Indexes** | ✅ APPROVED | userId index for RLS performance, documentId unique serves as index |
| **RLS Compatibility** | ✅ APPROVED | userId field + traversal via Document → Person → ownerId |
| **Provenance** | ✅ APPROVED | `model` field documents AI model (critical for medical app) |

## Migration SQL Validation

### Generated SQL (Corrected)

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "Summary" (
  "id" TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()::text,
  "documentId" TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  "userId" TEXT,
  "summaryText" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "structuredJson" JSONB,
  "model" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

  CONSTRAINT "Summary_documentId_fkey"
    FOREIGN KEY ("documentId")
    REFERENCES "Document"("id")
    ON DELETE CASCADE
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "Summary_userId_idx" ON "Summary"("userId");
```

### SQL Validation Results

| Check | Result | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Idempotency** | ✅ PASS | `IF NOT EXISTS` prevents duplicate table errors |
| **UUID Generation** | ✅ PASS | `gen_random_uuid()` for PostgreSQL |
| **Timestamp Precision** | ✅ PASS | TIMESTAMP(3) matches Prisma precision |
| **Foreign Key Naming** | ✅ PASS | Constraint name follows Prisma convention |
| **Index Creation** | ✅ PASS | `IF NOT EXISTS` for safe re-application |

## RLS Policy Validation

### Policy 1: summary_owner_select

```sql
CREATE POLICY "summary_owner_select" ON "Summary"
FOR SELECT USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM "Document" d
    JOIN "Person" p ON p.id = d."personId"
    WHERE d.id = "Summary"."documentId"
      AND p."ownerId" = auth.uid()::text  -- Type casting required
  )
);
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Correct table traversal (Summary → Document → Person)
- ✅ Type casting applied (UUID → TEXT)
- ✅ Uses EXISTS for optimized performance
- ✅ Applies to SELECT operations only

### Policy 2: summary_owner_mod

```sql
CREATE POLICY "summary_owner_mod" ON "Summary"
FOR ALL USING (...) WITH CHECK (...);
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Covers INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- ✅ USING clause validates ownership on modification
- ✅ WITH CHECK clause validates ownership on creation
- ✅ Identical logic to SELECT policy (consistency)

### RLS Security Audit

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Multi-tenant Isolation** | ✅ PASS | Users cannot access other users' summaries |
| **Traverse Attack Prevention** | ✅ PASS | No direct user_id comparison (spoofing protected) |
| **Service Role Bypass** | ⚠️ AWARE | Service role bypasses RLS (documented for dev team) |
| **Policy Performance** | ✅ PASS | Indexed lookups, subquery EXISTS pattern |

## Issues Identified & Resolved

### Issue 1: Type Mismatch in RLS Policies

**Problem:**
```
ERROR: operator does not exist: text = uuid
```

**Root Cause:**
- `auth.uid()` returns UUID type
- `Person.ownerId` is TEXT type
- PostgreSQL cannot implicitly cast UUID to TEXT in RLS policies

**Resolution:**
Cast `auth.uid()` to TEXT in all RLS policies:

```sql
WHERE p."ownerId" = auth.uid()::text
```

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue 2: Prisma Migrations Blocked

**Problem:**
- `prisma migrate dev` fails
- Storage bucket migration `20251004000000_create_avatars_bucket` contains `INSERT INTO storage.buckets`
- Prisma cannot execute storage.* operations

**Root Cause:**
- Mixed Prisma-managed tables and Supabase-managed tables in same migration
- Supabase storage operations should not be in Prisma migrations

**Resolution:**
- Applied Summary migration manually via psql
- Documented separation strategy for future migrations
- Prisma migrations: Table DDL, constraints, indexes, RLS on application tables
- Supabase operations: Storage buckets, auth triggers, edge functions (apply via SQL Editor or `supabase db push`)

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (workaround documented)

**Long-term Fix Required:**
- [ ] Move storage bucket migration to separate file
- [ ] Apply manually via Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Resume normal Prisma workflow

## Performance Analysis

### Index Usage

| Index | Type | Purpose | Impact |
|-------|------|---------|--------|
| `Summary_pkey` | PRIMARY KEY | Unique row identification | Standard |
| `Summary_documentId_key` | UNIQUE | One-to-one enforcement + FK lookup | High (used in RLS policies) |
| `Summary_userId_idx` | BTREE | RLS policy optimization | Medium (reduces policy query time) |

### RLS Policy Query Plan

**Policy Logic:**
```
Summary → Document (FK lookup) → Person (FK lookup) → ownerId = auth.uid()
```

**Expected Performance:**
1. **Summary lookup:** Primary key or documentId (indexed, O(1))
2. **JOIN Document:** Foreign key index (fast)
3. **JOIN Person:** Foreign key index (fast)
4. **EXISTS subquery:** PostgreSQL optimizes to semi-join

**Projected Query Time:** < 10ms for typical summary retrieval

### Scalability Considerations

| Scenario | Expected Load | Performance | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Single summary retrieval | 1 query per request | ✅ Fast | Indexed lookups |
| Bulk summary retrieval | N queries (N documents) | ⚠️ Watch | Consider JOIN in application code |
| Summary creation | 1 INSERT per document | ✅ Fast | No complex triggers |
| Summary update | 1 UPDATE per document | ✅ Fast | No cascading updates |

**Recommendation:** Monitor slow query log in Supabase Dashboard. No immediate optimization needed for MVP.

## Rollback Strategy

### Immediate Rollback (Emergency)

**If critical issue detected within 1 hour of deployment:**

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "Summary" CASCADE;
```

**Impact:**
- All Summary data lost (none exists in DEV currently)
- Foreign key constraints removed
- RLS policies removed
- No impact on Document or other tables

**Recovery Time:** < 1 minute

### Partial Rollback (RLS Issues)

**If RLS policies cause issues but table is fine:**

```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "summary_owner_select" ON "Summary";
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "summary_owner_mod" ON "Summary";
ALTER TABLE "Summary" DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Impact:**
- Table remains
- Data preserved
- RLS enforcement removed (security risk - use only temporarily)

**Recovery Time:** < 30 seconds

### Application Code Rollback

**If application code deployed that depends on Summary:**

1. Revert application deployment to previous version
2. Keep Summary table in database (empty table safe)
3. Schedule proper rollback in maintenance window

**Recovery Time:** 5-10 minutes (depends on deployment pipeline)

## Storage Bucket Migration Issue

### Problem Statement

Migration `20251004000000_create_avatars_bucket` contains:

```sql
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES ('avatars', 'avatars', true, 5242880, ARRAY[...]);
```

This causes Prisma migrations to fail because:
- Prisma manages application tables (Document, Person, Summary)
- Supabase manages infrastructure tables (storage.buckets, auth.users)
- Prisma cannot execute operations on storage.* schema

### Recommended Solution

**Separate migration concerns:**

1. **Prisma Migrations** (via `prisma migrate dev`):
   - Application table DDL
   - Foreign keys and constraints
   - Indexes on application tables
   - RLS policies on application tables

2. **Supabase Operations** (via SQL Editor or `supabase db push`):
   - Storage bucket creation/configuration
   - Storage RLS policies (on `storage.objects`)
   - Auth hooks and triggers
   - Edge function permissions

**Action Items:**

```bash
# 1. Move storage migration to separate file
mv db/migrations/20251004000000_create_avatars_bucket/migration.sql \
   db/migrations/manual_supabase_storage_avatars.sql

# 2. Apply manually via Supabase SQL Editor
# (one-time operation per environment)

# 3. Resume Prisma workflow
npx prisma migrate dev --schema=db/schema.prisma
```

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (blocking future Prisma migrations)
