# Schema Synchronization Crisis - Complete Resolution

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Root Cause:** Broken development workflow causing schema drift
**Impact:** Technical debt eliminated, robust workflow established

---

## Executive Summary

The EverMed project experienced infinite Vercel build failures due to schema drift between local, staging, and production databases. The root cause was a fundamentally broken development workflow where:

1. Schema changes were made locally
2. Code was written against new types (worked locally)
3. Code was pushed to GitHub
4. Vercel builds failed because staging/production databases had old schema
5. Prisma generated types from old schema → types didn't match code
6. Fixes were applied, new errors appeared
7. **REPEAT INFINITELY**

This document provides a complete record of the crisis resolution and the systems put in place to prevent recurrence.

---

## The Problem (Diagnosed by External Expert)

### Broken Pipeline

```
1. Change schema locally
2. Code works locally (somehow?)
3. Push to GitHub
4. Vercel: ❌ Build fails - types don't match
5. Claude Code fixes it
6. Push again
7. Vercel: ❌ NEW error (next type mismatch in line)
8. REPEAT INFINITELY...
```

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Migrations not applied to staging/production**
   - Code expected: `eventType`, `eventName`, `metadata`, `sessionId`
   - Staging DB had: `userId`, `name`, `meta`
   - Vercel ran `prisma generate` against staging DB → old types
   - Code expected new types → **BUILD FAILED**

2. **No type regeneration before deployment**
   - Prisma Client generated from local DB only
   - Staging/production had different schemas
   - Types didn't match actual database structure

3. **No local build testing**
   - Using Vercel as "CI/CD type checker"
   - Slow (full deploy cycle)
   - Expensive (build minutes)
   - Frustrating (one error at a time)

4. **No pre-deployment checks**
   - No validation that migrations were applied
   - No schema verification before deployment
   - No workflow enforcement

### Evidence of Schema Drift

**Local (wukrnqifpgjwbqxpockm):**
- ✅ `analytics_events`: Table renamed, correct schema
- ✅ `personal_models`: 17 columns (correct)

**Staging (jwarorrwgpqrksrxmesx):**
- ❌ `personal_models`: MISSING (migration never applied)
- ❌ `analytics_events`: MISSING (migration never applied)
- ❌ Missing 3 critical migrations

**Production (nqlxlkhbriqztkzwbdif):**
- ❌ `personal_models`: MISSING
- ❌ `analytics_events`: MISSING
- ❌ Failed migration blocking all subsequent migrations
- **Frozen at Sept 17** - essentially 3+ weeks behind

## The Solution

### Part 1: Immediate Schema Fixes

#### 1.1 Schema Inspection

Connected to all three environments and inspected actual table structures:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'analytics_events';

SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'personal_models';
```

**Findings:**
- Staging and production were 3+ weeks behind local
- Multiple migrations created but never applied
- PersonalModel schema had wrong structure (migration created with old schema, then Prisma schema modified after)

#### 1.2 Corrective Migration Created

**File:** `db/migrations/20251011000000_fix_personal_model_schema/migration.sql`

**Features:**
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Data-preserving (migrates old data before dropping columns)
- Handles both old schema (`model_version`) and new schema (`version`)
- Adds missing columns: `modelType`, `version`, `isActive`, `trainingDataStart`, `trainingDataEnd`, `trainedAt`, `lastUsedAt`, `accuracyMae`, `accuracyR2`, `metadata`
- Fixes unique constraints

#### 1.3 All Environments Synchronized

**Local:**
- ✅ All migrations applied
- ✅ `analytics_events` renamed and updated
- ✅ `personal_models` has 17 columns
- ✅ Schema validation: ALL TESTS PASSED

**Staging:**
- ✅ Applied 4 missing migrations
- ✅ `analytics_events` created with correct schema
- ✅ `personal_models` created and corrected
- ✅ Schema validation: ALL TESTS PASSED

**Production:**
- ✅ Fixed failed migration
- ✅ Applied 4 missing migrations
- ✅ All tables synchronized
- ✅ Schema validation: ALL TESTS PASSED

### Part 2: Workflow Architecture Fixes

#### 2.1 Pre-Push Validation Script

**File:** `scripts/pre-push-checks.sh`

Validates before every push:
- ✅ TypeScript type check passes
- ✅ ESLint passes
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ No uncommitted migrations

**Integrated with Husky:**
- Runs automatically on `git push`
- Blocks push if validation fails
- Provides immediate feedback

#### 2.2 Deployment Runbooks

**Staging:** `scripts/deploy-staging.sh`
1. Validates local build
2. Applies migrations to staging DB
3. Validates schema synchronization
4. Provides next steps

**Production:** `scripts/deploy-production.sh`
1. Prompts for backup confirmation
2. Validates staging deployment succeeded
3. Applies migrations to production DB
4. Validates schema synchronization
5. Provides rollback instructions

#### 2.3 Schema Validation Test Script

**File:** `scripts/test-schema.mjs`

Validates database schema matches Prisma schema:
- Tests AnalyticsEvent, PersonalModel, FoodEntry, FeatureFlag
- Can run against any environment (local/staging/production)
- Exits with error if schema mismatch detected

#### 2.4 Standard Operating Procedures

**Database Changes SOP:** `.claude/sops/database-changes.md`
- 14-step workflow for schema changes
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Emergency schema drift fix procedures
- Rollback procedures

**Deployment SOP:** `.claude/sops/deployment.md`
- Pre-deployment checklists
- Staging deployment workflow
- Production deployment workflow with safety gates
- Rollback procedures
- Hotfix workflow

#### 2.5 Developer Workflow Documentation

**File:** `docs/DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md`

Comprehensive guide covering:
- Making schema changes (step-by-step)
- Before every push checklist
- Deploying to staging
- Deploying to production
- Common mistakes to avoid (with examples)
- Troubleshooting guide

### Part 3: Enforcement & Prevention

#### 3.1 Git Hooks (Husky)

**Installed:** Husky 9.1.7

**Pre-push hook:** `.husky/pre-push`
- Runs `./scripts/pre-push-checks.sh` automatically
- Blocks push if validation fails
- Cannot be bypassed (unless `--no-verify` explicitly used)

#### 3.2 GitHub Actions CI/CD

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Jobs:**
1. `validate-schema` - Validates migrations and schema compatibility
2. `build-and-test` - Full build and test suite

**Both must pass before PR merge.**

#### 3.3 Branch Protection (Recommended)

**File:** `docs/GITHUB_CONFIGURATION.md`

Provides step-by-step configuration for:
- Branch protection rules (`main`, `staging`, `dev`)
- Required status checks
- Environment secrets
- Staging/production deployment workflows
- Weekly schema drift check (cron job)

#### 3.4 CLAUDE.md Updates

Added new section: **Schema Change Workflow (MANDATORY)**

Documents:
- Pre-push validation requirement
- 14-step workflow for schema changes
- What NEVER to do
- Why the workflow exists (references October 2025 crisis)
- Links to all documentation

## Next Steps for Developers

### Immediate

1. ✅ **All databases synchronized** - Ready for deployment
2. ✅ **Vercel builds should succeed** - No more type mismatches
3. ✅ **Can safely deploy** - Staging and production ready

### Going Forward

**Before Every Push:**
```bash
./scripts/pre-push-checks.sh
# Or just let Husky run it automatically
```

**Before Staging Deploy:**
```bash
./scripts/deploy-staging.sh
```

**Before Production Deploy:**
```bash
./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```

**For Schema Changes:**
- Follow `docs/DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md`
- Follow `.claude/sops/database-changes.md`
- Use database-architect subagent

**For Deployments:**
- Follow `.claude/sops/deployment.md`
- Always deploy to staging first
- Verify staging before production

### Test Deployment Flow

1. Push code to GitHub (triggers Vercel build)
2. Vercel build will succeed because:
   - Staging DB has new schema ✅
   - `prisma generate` generates types from staging DB ✅
   - Code expects new types ✅
   - **Types match → Build succeeds!** ✅

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong

1. **Workflow was broken, not the code**
   - Schema changes were treated like code changes
   - Databases need migrations, type regeneration, deployment steps

2. **Using Vercel as a "type checker"**
   - Slow feedback loop (2-3 minutes per build)
   - One error at a time
   - Wastes build minutes

3. **No validation before deployment**
   - Migrations created but never applied
   - Schema drift accumulated over weeks
   - No way to detect drift until build failed

4. **Modifying Prisma schema after migration creation**
   - Created permanent drift
   - Migration SQL didn't match schema
   - Impossible to fix without manual intervention

### What Worked

1. **Database-architect subagent**
   - Comprehensive diagnosis
   - Created corrective migrations
   - Applied migrations to all environments
   - Validated synchronization

2. **Automated validation scripts**
   - Pre-push checks catch errors early
   - Schema validation scripts detect drift
   - Deployment runbooks enforce correct workflow

3. **Comprehensive documentation**
   - SOPs provide clear guidance
   - Developer workflow prevents mistakes
   - Crisis resolution documents lessons learned

4. **Git hooks enforcement**
   - Husky pre-push hook prevents bad commits
   - Cannot accidentally push without validation
   - Immediate feedback at commit time

---

## Prevention Strategy

### Never Again

The following safeguards ensure this crisis cannot recur:

1. **Pre-Push Validation** (Husky)
   - Automatic validation before every push
   - Blocks push if validation fails
   - Cannot be bypassed without explicit flag

2. **CI Enforcement** (GitHub Actions)
   - validate-schema job runs on every PR
   - Blocks merge if schema drift detected
   - Requires all checks to pass

3. **Deployment Runbooks** (Scripts)
   - Enforces migration-first approach
   - Validates schema after migration
   - Provides rollback instructions

4. **Documentation** (SOPs + Guides)
   - Clear 14-step workflow
   - Common mistakes documented
   - Troubleshooting guidance

5. **Education** (CLAUDE.md)
   - Crisis explained in project docs
   - Workflow rationale documented
   - Links to all resources

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

**Weekly Schema Drift Check:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/schema-drift-check.yml
# Runs every Monday, creates GitHub issue if drift detected
```

**Automatic Staging Deployment:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml
# Applies migrations automatically when pushing to staging branch
```

**Production Deployment with Approval:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml
# Requires manual approval before applying production migrations
```
