## üö® BLOCKER: Missing Supabase Credentials

### Problem
iOS app stuck on splash screen when running in simulator.

### Root Cause
The `apps/mobile/.env` file was missing. I created it with placeholder values, but you need to add your actual Supabase credentials for the auth system to initialize.

### Symptoms
- App shows old "GlucoLens" splash screen indefinitely
- Login screen never appears
- Metro bundler shows no errors (silent failure)
- Clearing cache didn't help

### Why This Happens
The Supabase client in `apps/mobile/src/api/supabase.ts` requires these environment variables:
```typescript
const supabaseUrl = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
```

Without these, `AuthContext` fails to initialize and the app gets stuck.

---

## ‚úÖ How to Fix (5-10 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your EverMed project
3. Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí API**
4. Copy these two values:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://abc123.supabase.co`)
   - **anon / public key** (long JWT string starting with `eyJ`)

### Step 2: Update the .env File

Edit `apps/mobile/.env` and replace the placeholder values:

```bash
# Replace with your actual Supabase credentials
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...your-actual-key

# This should be correct already
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://getclarimed.com
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:**
- Use your PRODUCTION Supabase project (not staging)
- Ensure no extra spaces or newlines in the values
- The anon key should be the **public anon key**, not the service role key

### Step 3: Restart Metro Bundler

Kill any running Metro process and start fresh:

```bash
# Kill Metro
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9

# Navigate to mobile app
cd apps/mobile

# Start with cache clear
npm start -- --clear
```

### Step 4: Reload the App

In the iOS Simulator:
- Press **Cmd+R** to reload
- Or shake device (Cmd+Ctrl+Z) and tap "Reload"

### Step 5: Verify It Works

You should now see:
- ‚úÖ **Login screen** (not the splash screen!)
- ‚úÖ Console log: "App.tsx is running!"
- ‚úÖ No errors in Metro bundler
- ‚úÖ Auth context initialized

If you still see errors, check:
- Metro bundler terminal for JavaScript errors
- iOS simulator console (Cmd+/) for runtime errors
- Verify credentials have no typos or extra characters

**Detailed Troubleshooting:** See `apps/mobile/README_SETUP.md`
