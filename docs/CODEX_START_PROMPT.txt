MODEL: GPT-5-Codex

Read `/docs/BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT.md` and follow it EXACTLY.

Then:

1) Print **Repo & Branch Health** and a **Dry-Run changeset** (no writes yet):
   - List every file you plan to add/edit/delete, grouped by path.

2) Enforce safety gates from `AGENTS.md`:
   - If any deletion or edit touches protected paths (“Do-not-touch”), ABORT and ask for explicit approval.
   - Do not modify env templates except to append **commented** examples.
   - Work only on a feature branch; open a PR; no direct commits to `main`.

3) Determine the next PR:
   - If Share Pack endpoints AND Chat with citations exist, continue at **PR #7 — Trend Views (labs, timelines)**.
   - Otherwise, resume from the earliest missing PR per `/docs/CODEX_REFIT_PLAN.md`.

4) Wait for my reply **“CHANGES APPROVED”** before writing files.
   - Use **GPT-5-Codex** for coding and strictly adhere to `AGENTS.md`.
   - If scope/process/CI/envs change, update docs in a separate `docs/sync-*` PR.

Stop after opening your feature PR. Print the PR link and a one-page summary of changes.
