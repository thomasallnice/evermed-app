# **EverMed â€” Project Description (Non-Technical)**

**Version:** 2.0 â€¢ October 15, 2025

**Product:** **Glucose Tracking & Metabolic Insights (non-SaMD)**

This document aligns product, design, and operations on what we're building now and why. It excludes implementation detail and regulatory filings.

---

## **1) Vision**

**An intelligent glucose tracking app that helps you understand how food affects your blood sugarâ€”with AI-powered meal logging, nutrition analysis, and personalized insights.**

---

## **2) Positioning & Wedge**

- **Problem:** Tracking meals is tedious; understanding glucose patterns is confusing; generic advice doesn't account for personal metabolic responses.

- **Wedge:** **Photo-first meal logging** (< 5 seconds), AI-powered food recognition, glucose-meal correlation analysis, and personalized insightsâ€”all with strong privacy and non-SaMD compliance.

- **Non-SaMD stance:** We **do not** diagnose diabetes, recommend medication changes, or provide medical treatment. We help users **understand patterns** and **prepare questions for their doctor**.


---

## **3) Who We Serve**

**Primary:** Adults tracking glucose for diabetes management, pre-diabetes, or metabolic health optimization.

**Secondary:** Health-conscious individuals using CGM devices (Dexcom, FreeStyle Libre) or fingerstick meters.

---

## **4) Value Proposition**

- **Fastest meal logging:** Take a photo, AI recognizes food in 15 seconds.

- **Automatic nutrition tracking:** Detailed macros, fiber, glycemic index from 900k+ food database.

- **Glucose-meal correlation:** See exactly how each meal affects your blood sugar over 2-4 hours.

- **Daily insights:** AI detects patterns (spikes after pasta, stable with eggs) and suggests questions for your doctor.

- **Privacy-first:** All data encrypted, never sold, user-controlled export/delete.


---

## **5) Regulatory Boundary (Non-SaMD)**

- **Non-SaMD:** Track, visualize, correlate, and explain patterns. Provide informational insights.

- **No diagnosis:** We never diagnose diabetes, pre-diabetes, or metabolic conditions.

- **No treatment advice:** We never recommend medication changes, insulin dosing, or specific treatments.

- **No emergency triage:** For urgent symptoms (extreme highs/lows, confusion), we direct users to seek immediate medical care.

- **Informational only:** All insights include disclaimers and encourage clinical consultation.


---

## **6) Security & Privacy Non-Negotiables**

- **Encryption:** All data encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256).

- **Row-Level Security (RLS):** Database policies ensure users can only access their own data.

- **No data selling:** We never sell user data to advertisers, insurers, or third parties.

- **GDPR/HIPAA-ready:** User-controlled export, deletion, and data portability.

- **Secure storage:** Food photos stored in private Supabase buckets with signed URLs.

- **Minimal retention:** Old photos auto-deleted after 90 days (configurable).

## **10) UI Patterns â€” Starter Cards**

Keep the UI simple; teach by example:

- "Log your first meal ðŸ“¸" â€¢ "Connect your CGM" â€¢ "What caused my spike?"
- "Weekly Summary ðŸ“Š" â€¢ "Best meals this week" â€¢ "Questions for my doctor"
- Starter cards appear on Home and as quick actions in the FAB

---

## **11) Output Contract â€” Daily Insights**

**Format:**
- **Pattern identified:** 1 sentence ("Your glucose spiked 4 times after breakfast this week")
- **Possible reason:** Carb/fiber ratio, meal timing, portion size
- **Suggestion (informational):** "Consider adding protein to stabilize blood sugar"
- **Question for your doctor:** "Should I adjust my breakfast carb intake?"
- **Disclaimer:** "This is not medical advice. Discuss with your healthcare provider."

**Latency target:** p95 < 2s for dashboard load, < 30s for AI meal analysis

---

## **12) Content & Tone**

- **Empowering, not clinical:** "You're doing great tracking!" vs. "Patient compliance detected"
- **Plain language:** "Blood sugar" instead of "glycemic index"
- **No scare tactics:** Avoid "dangerous" or "critical" unless truly urgent
- **Solution-oriented:** Focus on what users can control (meal choices, timing)
- **Encourage clinical partnership:** Always suggest doctor consultation for major changes

**Standard disclaimer (global):**
_"EverMed helps you track and understand glucose patterns. It doesn't diagnose conditions or replace medical advice. For treatment decisions, always consult your healthcare provider."_

---

## **13) Banned Topics (Non-SaMD Compliance)**

- Diabetes diagnosis ("You have Type 2 diabetes")
- Medication dosing ("Take 10 units of insulin")
- Emergency triage ("This is a medical emergency")
- Treatment recommendations ("You should start metformin")
- Automated disease classification ("This pattern indicates diabetic neuropathy")

**Always redirect to clinical care:**
- "If you're experiencing extreme glucose highs/lows, confusion, or severe symptoms, seek immediate medical care."
- "For questions about medication or treatment, please consult your healthcare provider."

## **20) Team FAQ**

**Is this a diagnostic tool?**
Noâ€”EverMed is a tracking and insights tool (non-SaMD). We do not diagnose diabetes or recommend treatment.

**What if a user's glucose is dangerously high/low?**
We display a warning: "If you're experiencing extreme glucose levels, confusion, or severe symptoms, seek immediate medical care." We never provide emergency triage.

**Do we support insulin dosing recommendations?**
Noâ€”this would be SaMD and requires FDA/CE Mark approval. Users must consult their doctor for all medication decisions.

**How accurate is the AI food recognition?**
85%+ accuracy on common foods (pizza, salad, chicken). Falls back to manual search for complex or uncommon meals.

**Can users export their data?**
Yesâ€”CSV export of all meals and glucose readings. Future: FHIR bundle export for clinical systems.

**What about GDPR/HIPAA compliance?**
- GDPR: User-controlled data export, deletion, and portability
- HIPAA: Not required (we're a consumer app, not a covered entity), but we follow best practices (encryption, RLS, audit logs)

---

## **TL;DR**

Ship an **intelligent glucose tracking app** with **photo-first meal logging** as the hero feature, AI-powered nutrition analysis, glucose-meal correlation, and daily insights. Keep diagnosis out of scope; focus on empowering users to understand patterns and prepare questions for their doctor. Strong privacy, non-SaMD compliance, and a light admin dashboard to monitor engagement and performance.
