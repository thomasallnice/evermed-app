## Opening Statement

"I need help with my existing Next.js app called EverMed. Here's the context:

**Project**: Family caregiver peace-of-mind app (NOT complex medical)
**Stack**: Next.js 15, Supabase, Tailwind CSS v4, TypeScript  
**Database**: Single `family_members` table (simplified from 50+ tables)
**Deployment**: Vercel on Frankfurt servers, 3 environments
**Philosophy**: Keep it simple - just track if family members are okay

The app is working and deployed. I need help with [YOUR SPECIFIC NEED].

Key technical details:
- Monorepo with frontend/ directory
- vercel.json at root (not in frontend/)
- Each environment has separate Supabase project
- Using Tailwind v4 with @tailwindcss/postcss
