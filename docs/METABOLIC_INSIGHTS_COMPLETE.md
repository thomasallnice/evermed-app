## Security & Compliance

### Privacy (Zero PHI Exposure) ✅

**Database Level**:
- All queries filter by `personId` (RLS enforcement)
- 36 RLS policies (4 per table: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Storage buckets use path-based isolation (`{userId}/*`)

**Analytics Level**:
- AnalyticsEvent has NO user identifiers (userId removed)
- `validatePrivacy()` blocks forbidden keys (userId, email, glucose, diagnosis)
- Session IDs hashed (SHA-256) for anonymized funnel tracking
- Admin dashboard shows aggregated metrics only (counts, averages, percentages)

**API Level**:
- All endpoints require authentication (`requireUserId`)
- Signed URLs expire after 1 hour
- No PHI in logs or error messages

### Medical Compliance (Non-SaMD) ✅

**Guardrails**:
- ❌ No diagnosis language ("You have diabetes")
- ❌ No dosing recommendations ("Take X units of insulin")
- ❌ No triage/urgency classification ("Seek emergency care")
- ✅ All predictions include medical disclaimers (3 types)
- ✅ Confidence intervals for predictions (high/medium/low)
- ✅ Provenance tracking (model version, training date, data points)

**Medical Disclaimers** (from `lib/copy.ts`):
1. `METABOLIC_INSIGHTS_DISCLAIMER` - Analytics and insights
2. `GLUCOSE_CORRELATION_DISCLAIMER` - Meal-glucose correlations
3. `GLUCOSE_PREDICTION_DISCLAIMER` - ML predictions (no insulin dosing)

### Performance ✅

**API Endpoints**:
- POST /api/metabolic/food: <500ms (photo upload + DB write)
- GET /api/metabolic/food: <300ms (with pagination)
- POST /api/predictions/glucose: <2s (cached models <50ms)

**Analytics Queries**:
- Correlation: <400ms (target: <2s)
- Timeline: <300ms (database-level aggregations)
- Insights: <200ms (single record fetch)

**Dashboard Performance** (Chrome DevTools MCP validated):
- LCP: 612ms (target: <2.5s) ✅
- FID: <100ms (target: <100ms) ✅
- CLS: 0.00 (target: <0.1) ✅
- Console Errors: 0 ✅

## Production Deployment

### Critical Blockers (Must Fix Before Launch)

1. **Apply Database Migrations** ⚠️
   ```bash
   # Sprint 1-3 migrations
   supabase db push --include-all

   # Or apply individually
   psql $DATABASE_URL -f db/migrations/20251010090000_add_metabolic_insights/migration.sql
   psql $DATABASE_URL -f db/migrations/20251010090001_add_metabolic_rls_policies/migration.sql
   psql $DATABASE_URL -f db/migrations/20250610000000_add_feature_flags_and_analytics/migration.sql
   ```

2. **Create Storage Buckets** ⚠️
   ```bash
   # food-photos (Sprint 1)
   ./scripts/setup-food-photos-bucket.sh prod

   # ml-models (Sprint 4)
   # Follow docs/ML_STORAGE_SETUP.md
   ```

3. **Implement Admin Authentication** ⚠️
   - Current: `isAdmin()` always returns `true` (placeholder)
   - Risk: Admin endpoints publicly accessible
   - Fix: Implement role-based auth (Supabase RLS or JWT claims)
   - File: `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`

4. **Integrate TensorFlow.js LSTM** ⚠️
   - Current: Mock baseline predictor
   - Required: Full LSTM training/inference
   - Dependency: `npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node`
   - Files: `apps/web/src/lib/ml/training.ts` (see TODO markers)
   - Timeline: 3-5 days

### Environment Variables (Vercel)

**Already Set**:
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

**New (Sprint 2)**:
```bash
GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=your-key-here
NUTRITIONIX_APP_ID=your-id-here
NUTRITIONIX_APP_KEY=your-key-here
USE_MOCK_APIS=false  # Optional, for testing
```

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# 1. Apply migrations
supabase link --project-ref <prod-ref>
supabase db push --include-all

# 2. Create storage buckets
./scripts/setup-food-photos-bucket.sh prod

# 3. Deploy to Vercel
git push origin feature/metabolic-insights
# Create PR → Merge to main → Auto-deploy

# 4. Verify deployment
./scripts/smoke-e2e.sh --auth
```

### Medium Priority (Enhancements)
4. CGM provider integrations (Dexcom/FreeStyle Libre OAuth)
5. Background job workers (Cloud Run for AI analysis, model training)
6. Retention metrics placeholders (cohort analysis not implemented)
7. API latency percentiles (requires JSON metadata parsing)

### Low Priority (Tech Debt)
8. Legacy admin metrics (type errors from old schema)
9. Performance metrics placeholders (some admin charts show 0)
