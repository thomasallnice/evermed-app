# Dexcom CGM Integration - Setup Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✅ Database Schema Ready, Service Layer Complete, API Routes Implemented
**Next Steps:** Apply migration to staging/production, configure environment variables

---

## What Was Completed

### 1. Database Schema ✅

**Added `CGMConnection` model to Prisma schema:**
- Stores encrypted OAuth tokens (access_token, refresh_token)
- Tracks connection status (connected, disconnected, error, expired)
- Supports multiple CGM providers (dexcom, libre)
- Includes sync metadata (lastSyncAt, syncCursor)
- Foreign key to Person table with CASCADE delete

**Added `cgmConnectionId` to `GlucoseReading` model:**
- Links glucose readings to their source CGM connection
- Optional field (SET NULL on connection delete)
- Indexed for performance

**Migration created:**
- File: `db/migrations/20251016_add_cgm_connection/migration.sql`
- Includes: Table creation, indexes, foreign keys, RLS policies
- **Not yet applied** - needs to be deployed to staging/production

**RLS Policies included:**
- Users can only view/insert/update/delete their own CGM connections
- Enforced through Person.ownerId = auth.uid() check

---

### 2. Service Layer ✅

**All service modules already exist and are production-ready:**

#### `/apps/web/src/lib/encryption.ts`
- AES-256-GCM encryption for OAuth tokens
- Random IV per encryption, authentication tags
- Validates ENCRYPTION_KEY at startup

#### `/apps/web/src/lib/services/dexcom-client.ts`
- Low-level Dexcom API client
- OAuth 2.0 token exchange and refresh
- EGV (glucose data) retrieval
- Exponential backoff retry logic (3 retries max)
- Rate limit handling (429 errors)
- TypeScript types with Zod schemas

#### `/apps/web/src/lib/services/dexcom.ts`
- High-level service wrapper
- OAuth flow management
- Automatic token refresh (when < 5 minutes until expiry)
- Incremental glucose sync with cursor
- Connection status management
- Database integration (uses Prisma)

---

### 3. API Routes ✅

**All routes exist and are ready:**

#### `POST /api/metabolic/cgm/dexcom/connect`
- Generates OAuth authorization URL
- Returns authUrl for user to authenticate with Dexcom

#### `GET /api/metabolic/cgm/dexcom/callback`
- Handles OAuth callback
- Exchanges code for tokens
- Encrypts and stores in database
- Redirects to dashboard

#### `POST /api/metabolic/cgm/dexcom/sync`
- Manually triggers glucose data sync
- Fetches readings since lastSyncAt (or 7 days)
- Stores in GlucoseReading table

#### `GET /api/metabolic/cgm/dexcom/status`
- Returns connection status
- Shows lastSyncAt, deviceId, error messages

#### `DELETE /api/metabolic/cgm/dexcom/disconnect` ✅ **NEWLY ADDED**
- Disconnects Dexcom account
- Removes stored tokens
- Cleans up connection record

---

### 4. Testing Infrastructure ✅

**Mock implementation exists:**
- File: `/tests/mocks/dexcom-mock.ts`
- Generates realistic glucose data
- Enable with `USE_MOCK_DEXCOM=true`

---

### 5. Documentation ✅

**Comprehensive documentation exists:**
- `/docs/DEXCOM_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete integration guide
- `/docs/DEXCOM_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary
- `/docs/DEXCOM_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This file

**Environment variables updated:**
- `.env.example` now includes all Dexcom variables

---

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Apply Database Migration (REQUIRED)

**Option A: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
# Link to staging environment
supabase link --project-ref <staging-ref>

# Preview migration
supabase db diff

# Apply migration
supabase db push
```

**Option B: Using Prisma Migrate**
```bash
# Set DATABASE_URL
export DATABASE_URL=<supabase-connection-string>

# Apply migration
npm run prisma:migrate:deploy
```

**Option C: Manual SQL Execution**
```bash
# Run migration SQL directly in Supabase SQL Editor
# File: db/migrations/20251016_add_cgm_connection/migration.sql
```

---

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

**Vercel Production Environment:**
```bash
# Dexcom OAuth credentials (from Dexcom Developer Portal)
DEXCOM_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
DEXCOM_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
DEXCOM_REDIRECT_URI=https://glucolens.com/api/metabolic/cgm/dexcom/callback
DEXCOM_API_BASE_URL=https://api.dexcom.com  # Production URL

# Generate encryption key
ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

**Vercel Staging Environment:**
```bash
DEXCOM_CLIENT_ID=<sandbox-client-id>
DEXCOM_CLIENT_SECRET=<sandbox-client-secret>
DEXCOM_REDIRECT_URI=https://staging.glucolens.com/api/metabolic/cgm/dexcom/callback
DEXCOM_API_BASE_URL=https://sandbox-api.dexcom.com  # Sandbox URL
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<same-as-production-or-different>
```

**Local Development (.env.local):**
```bash
DEXCOM_CLIENT_ID=<sandbox-client-id>
DEXCOM_CLIENT_SECRET=<sandbox-client-secret>
DEXCOM_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/metabolic/cgm/dexcom/callback
DEXCOM_API_BASE_URL=https://sandbox-api.dexcom.com
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<dev-encryption-key>

# Optional: Use mock for testing without Dexcom account
USE_MOCK_DEXCOM=true
```

---

### 3. Obtain Dexcom OAuth Credentials

**Sandbox (Development/Testing):**
1. Go to https://developer.dexcom.com
2. Create developer account
3. Create new sandbox application
4. Configure redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/metabolic/cgm/dexcom/callback`
5. Copy CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET

**Production (Real Users):**
1. Request production access from Dexcom
2. Submit application for review (requires business details, privacy policy, terms of service)
3. Approval process takes 2-4 weeks
4. Configure production redirect URI: `https://glucolens.com/api/metabolic/cgm/dexcom/callback`
5. Use production credentials

---

### 4. Test Integration

**Staging Smoke Test:**
```bash
# 1. Navigate to app
open https://staging.glucolens.com/dashboard/metabolic

# 2. Click "Connect Dexcom" button (needs UI implementation)

# 3. Authorize with Dexcom sandbox account

# 4. Verify callback redirects to dashboard

# 5. Trigger manual sync
curl -X POST https://staging.glucolens.com/api/metabolic/cgm/dexcom/sync \
  -H "x-user-id: <test-user-id>"

# 6. Check glucose readings in database
# Navigate to Supabase > glucose_readings table
# Filter by source='cgm'

# 7. Verify RLS policies work
# Try to access another user's CGM connection (should fail)
```

---

### 5. Monitor & Validate

**After deployment, check:**
- [ ] Migration applied successfully (no errors in Supabase logs)
- [ ] RLS policies enabled on `cgm_connections` table
- [ ] OAuth flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Token refresh works (check after 2 hours)
- [ ] Glucose readings sync correctly
- [ ] Timestamps are in correct timezone
- [ ] Users can disconnect accounts
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] No API keys or tokens in logs

## Troubleshooting

**Migration fails with "relation already exists":**
- Drop table manually: `DROP TABLE cgm_connections CASCADE;`
- Drop enum: `DROP TYPE "CGMConnectionStatus";`
- Re-run migration

**"CGM_ENCRYPTION_KEY not set":**
- Generate key: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- Add to environment variables
- Restart application

**OAuth callback fails:**
- Verify DEXCOM_REDIRECT_URI matches Dexcom Developer Portal exactly
- Check for HTTPS (required in production)
- Verify CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET are correct

**Token refresh fails:**
- User must reconnect Dexcom account
- Old tokens become invalid after ~2 hours
- Check Dexcom API status: https://status.dexcom.com

**No glucose readings imported:**
- Verify Dexcom sandbox account has test data
- Check date range (default: last 7 days)
- Verify source='cgm' in database
- Check logs for API errors

✅ **Migration SQL** created with RLS policies
✅ **Service layer** implemented (OAuth, sync, encryption)
✅ **API routes** complete (connect, callback, sync, status, disconnect)
✅ **Testing infrastructure** ready (mock client, test fixtures)
✅ **Documentation** comprehensive (integration guide, troubleshooting)
✅ **Environment variables** documented (.env.example)

**Next immediate action:**
Apply database migration to staging environment:
