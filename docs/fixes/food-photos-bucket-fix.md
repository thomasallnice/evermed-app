# Food Photos Bucket Fix - Storage Configuration

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Issue:** OpenAI Vision API could not access uploaded food photos
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem Summary

Food photo uploads were succeeding, but the OpenAI Vision API was failing to analyze them with error:

```
BadRequestError: 400 Error while downloading https://wukrnqifpgjwbqxpockm.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/food-photos/...
code: 'invalid_image_url'
```

## Root Cause

The `food-photos` Supabase Storage bucket was configured as **PRIVATE** instead of **PUBLIC**, preventing OpenAI's servers from downloading the images via public URLs.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Bucket Configuration

Changed the bucket from PRIVATE to PUBLIC using SQL:

```sql
UPDATE storage.buckets
SET public = true
WHERE name = 'food-photos';
```

**Executed via:** `/Users/Tom/Arbeiten/Arbeiten/2025_EverMed/scripts/apply-bucket-fix-prisma.ts`

### 2. Verified Configuration

Confirmed bucket settings:
- **Bucket Name:** `food-photos`
- **Public:** `true` ✅
- **File Size Limit:** 10MB (10485760 bytes)
- **Allowed MIME Types:**
  - `image/jpeg`
  - `image/jpg`
  - `image/png`
  - `image/heic`
  - `image/webp`

### 3. Tested End-to-End

Successfully tested:
- ✅ Photo upload to storage
- ✅ Public URL generation
- ✅ URL accessibility via HTTP
- ✅ OpenAI Vision API access to photo
- ✅ Food analysis completion

**Test Result:**
```
Photo: a7c40e05-c7d4-4025-9c0c-5335c16c055c/meals/1760213802452.jpg
Public URL: https://wukrnqifpgjwbqxpockm.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/food-photos/...
OpenAI Response: "In the image, I see: 1. Boiled eggs 2. Hummus 3. Cherry tomatoes..."
Status: SUCCESS
```

## Security Considerations

### Why Public Access is Safe

1. **Non-PHI Data**: Food photos are NOT medical records or protected health information
2. **Obscure URLs**: Storage paths include UUID-based personId + timestamp (not guessable)
3. **Required for Integration**: OpenAI Vision API requires publicly accessible URLs
4. **Write Protection**: Upload/delete still requires authentication (RLS enforced)

### Current RLS Policies

The bucket has the following policies on `storage.objects`:

```sql
-- Public read access (for OpenAI Vision API)
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for food photos"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'food-photos');

-- Authenticated users can upload to their folder
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload food photos to their folder"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'food-photos'
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Users can delete their own photos
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own food photos"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'food-photos'
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);
```

**Note:** These policies are applied in `/Users/Tom/Arbeiten/Arbeiten/2025_EverMed/scripts/fix-food-photos-bucket.sql`

## Verification Scripts Created

### 1. Check Bucket Configuration
```bash
npx tsx scripts/check-bucket-config.ts
```
Shows: bucket name, public status, file size limit, allowed MIME types

### 2. Verify Bucket Configuration
```bash
npx tsx scripts/verify-food-photos-bucket.ts
```
Tests: bucket exists, is public, upload works, public URL is accessible

### 3. Test OpenAI Vision Access
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-existing-photo.ts
```
Tests: OpenAI Vision API can download and analyze existing food photos

## Implementation Details

### API Route Context
**File:** `/Users/Tom/Arbeiten/Arbeiten/2025_EverMed/apps/web/src/app/api/metabolic/food/route.ts`

Lines 152-156 generate the public URL:
```typescript
const { data: urlData } = supabase.storage
  .from('food-photos')
  .getPublicUrl(storagePath)

const photoUrl = urlData.publicUrl
```

Line 160 passes this URL to OpenAI:
```typescript
const analysisResult = await analyzeFoodPhoto(photoUrl)
```

### Analysis Function
**File:** `/Users/Tom/Arbeiten/Arbeiten/2025_EverMed/apps/web/src/lib/food-analysis.ts`

Line 74-76 use the image URL:
```typescript
{
  type: 'image_url',
  image_url: {
    url: photoUrl,
    detail: 'high'
  }
}
```

## Deployment Notes

### For Staging/Production

1. **Link to target environment:**
   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref <staging-or-prod-ref>
   ```

2. **Apply the fix:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/apply-bucket-fix-prisma.ts
   ```

3. **Verify:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/verify-food-photos-bucket.ts
   ```

4. **Test with real photo (if available):**
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/test-existing-photo.ts
   ```

### Alternative: Manual SQL in Supabase Dashboard

If CLI doesn't work, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
UPDATE storage.buckets
SET public = true
WHERE name = 'food-photos';
```

Then verify:

```sql
SELECT name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types, created_at
FROM storage.buckets
WHERE name = 'food-photos';
```

## Success Criteria

- [x] Bucket exists
- [x] Bucket is PUBLIC
- [x] Public URLs are accessible via HTTP
- [x] OpenAI Vision API can download images
- [x] Food photo analysis completes successfully
- [x] RLS policies protect write operations
- [x] Verification scripts pass

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix applied to development environment
2. ⏳ Apply to staging environment
3. ⏳ Apply to production environment
4. ⏳ Update memory files with this fix

## Related Issues

- Previous food photo uploads were marked as `analysisStatus: 'failed'` due to this issue
- Any food entries created before 2025-10-11 20:30 UTC may have failed analysis
- Consider re-analyzing failed photos (optional enhancement)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify external API access requirements** - OpenAI needs public URLs
2. **Bucket defaults matter** - Supabase buckets are PRIVATE by default
3. **Create verification scripts early** - Automated testing catches config issues faster
4. **Document security trade-offs** - Explain why public access is acceptable for non-PHI data
