## Rationale for Choosing Gemini 2.5 Flash

Despite GPT-4.1-mini being cheaper and faster, Gemini 2.5 Flash was selected for the following reasons:

### 1. Superior Contextual Understanding

**Example: Chicken Kiev Analysis**
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash:** Correctly identified as "Fried Chicken Cutlet (stuffed with herbs)" at 200g with 877 calories
- **GPT-4.1-mini:** Misidentified as "Breaded fried chicken strips" at 120g with 406 calories

This demonstrates Gemini's ability to recognize specific dishes and estimate portions more accurately, which is critical for metabolic health tracking.

### 2. Google Cloud Platform Alignment

- **Unified ecosystem:** Already using Google Cloud for infrastructure
- **Vertex AI integration:** Seamless deployment and monitoring
- **Enterprise support:** Better SLA and support options with Google Cloud

### 3. Advanced Cost Optimization Features

**Context Caching:**
- **Gemini:** 90% discount on cached inputs ($0.030 per 1M tokens)
- **GPT-4.1-mini:** 75% discount

**Batch API:**
- **Gemini:** 50% discount for async processing ($0.15 per 1M input tokens)
- **GPT-4.1-mini:** 50% discount (same)

With context caching implemented, projected monthly cost drops from $16.32 to ~$5-7/month (assuming 70% cache hit rate).

### 4. Multimodal Capabilities

- **Audio input:** $1 per 1M tokens - enables voice-based food logging
- **Future-proof:** Better positioned for multi-modal health tracking (audio descriptions, video analysis)

### 5. Strategic Long-Term Fit

- Med-PaLM 2 successor (healthcare-optimized AI)
- Google's focus on healthcare and life sciences
- Better alignment with future features (glucose prediction, CGM integration, health insights)

## Trade-offs Accepted

By choosing Gemini 2.5 Flash over GPT-4.1-mini, we accept:

‚ùå **33% higher cost** - $16.32/month vs $10.98/month (mitigated with caching to ~$5-7/month)
‚ùå **18% slower response** - 10.5s vs 8.6s average (still well under 30s timeout)
‚ùå **Less granular garnishes** - May miss small toppings like paprika or pepper flakes

These trade-offs are acceptable given the superior contextual understanding and strategic fit.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Production Deployment (Week 1)
- [x] Benchmark completed
- [x] Documentation updated
- [ ] Update pricing constants in `food-analysis-gemini.ts`
- [ ] Set `USE_GEMINI_FOOD_ANALYSIS=true` in production
- [ ] Deploy to staging for validation
- [ ] Deploy to production

### Phase 2: Optimization (Month 1)
- [ ] Implement context caching (90% discount on system prompts)
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics (accuracy, speed, cost)
- [ ] Collect user feedback on ingredient detection quality
- [ ] Optimize prompt for better granularity

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Quarter 1)
- [ ] Implement Batch API for historical data processing
- [ ] Add voice-based food logging (audio input)
- [ ] Explore fine-tuning for EverMed-specific foods
- [ ] A/B test Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite ($0.10 input, $0.40 output) for simple meals

## Rollback Plan

If Gemini 2.5 Flash fails to meet success criteria:

### Plan A: Switch to GPT-4.1-mini
- Set `USE_GEMINI_FOOD_ANALYSIS=false` in API route
- Model will fall back to existing OpenAI implementation
- Deploy time: < 5 minutes (feature flag toggle)

### Plan B: Hybrid Approach
- Use GPT-4.1-mini for simple meals (70%)
- Use Gemini 2.5 Flash for complex dishes (30%)
- Implement routing logic based on image complexity heuristics

### Plan C: Evaluate GPT-5-mini
- Benchmark GPT-5-mini ($2.26 per 1000 photos)
- May offer middle ground between cost and contextual understanding
