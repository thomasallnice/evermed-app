# Storage RLS Implementation: Documents Bucket

## Overview

Comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies have been implemented for the `documents` storage bucket to enforce multi-tenant data isolation and secure file access.

## Deployment Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION
**Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (db.wukrnqifpgjwbqxpockm.supabase.co)

## Security Model: Transitive Ownership

### Ownership Chain

```
Storage Path → personId → Person.ownerId → auth.uid()
```

**Example**:
- File path: `f087d811-e0c6-4308-bda4-a47138cad662/1234567890-report.pdf`
- PersonId extracted: `f087d811-e0c6-4308-bda4-a47138cad662`
- Person.ownerId: `39595793-fb6f-46bc-99a7-420279f4db95`
- User with `auth.uid() = 39595793-fb6f-46bc-99a7-420279f4db95` → **ACCESS GRANTED**
- Any other user → **ACCESS DENIED**

### Why Transitive Ownership?

Unlike the `food-photos` and `ml-models` buckets (which use `{auth.uid()}/*` paths), the `documents` bucket uses `{personId}/*` paths. This design:

1. Maintains the Person abstraction layer in the data model
2. Allows for future multi-profile support per user
3. Matches existing upload endpoint implementation
4. Preserves backward compatibility with existing files

## Policies Deployed

### 1. INSERT Policy: Upload to Own Person Folder

**Name**: `Users can upload documents to own person folder`

**Logic**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload documents to own person folder"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'documents'
  AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
  AND (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM "Person"
      WHERE "Person".id::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
      AND "Person"."ownerId" = auth.uid()::text
    )
  )
);
```

**Effect**: Users can only upload files to folders for Person records they own.

### 2. SELECT Policy: View Own Documents

**Name**: `Users can view own documents`

**Logic**: Same ownership check as INSERT policy using `USING` clause.

**Effect**: Users can only view/download files in their own Person folders.

### 3. UPDATE Policy: Update Own Documents

**Name**: `Users can update own documents`

**Logic**: Same ownership check on both `USING` and `WITH CHECK` clauses.

**Effect**: Users can only update metadata (e.g., content-type) of their own files.

### 4. DELETE Policy: Delete Own Documents

**Name**: `Users can delete own documents`

**Logic**: Same ownership check as SELECT policy.

**Effect**: Users can only delete files in their own Person folders.

## Performance Optimization

### Index Created

```sql
CREATE INDEX "Person_id_ownerId_idx" ON "Person"("id", "ownerId");
```

**Purpose**: Accelerates the EXISTS subquery in all RLS policies by providing fast lookup on both columns used in the ownership check.

**Query Plan**: With this index, policy evaluation is O(log n) instead of O(n).

## Bucket Configuration

```yaml
Bucket ID: documents
Public: false (private bucket)
File Size Limit: 10MB (10485760 bytes)
Allowed MIME Types:
  - application/pdf
  - image/jpeg
  - image/jpg
  - image/png
```

## Security Guarantees

### ✅ What's Protected

1. **Cross-User Access Blocked**: User A cannot access User B's files, even with direct URL knowledge
2. **Orphaned Files Inaccessible**: Files with invalid personId (Person record deleted) cannot be accessed
3. **Authentication Required**: Unauthenticated requests are denied (`auth.uid() IS NOT NULL`)
4. **Transitive Ownership Enforced**: All access requires valid ownership chain through Person table
5. **Service Role Bypass**: Service role (used by API endpoints) can access all files for legitimate operations

### ✅ Attack Scenarios Prevented

- **Path Traversal**: Cannot access files in other users' folders
- **Direct Object Reference**: Cannot access files by guessing URLs
- **Privilege Escalation**: Cannot elevate access to other users' data
- **Session Fixation**: Each request validates current auth.uid() from session

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Orphaned Files

**Scenario**: Person record deleted, but storage files remain
**Behavior**: RLS policies deny all access (EXISTS check fails)
**Solution**: Implement cleanup job or delete files on Person cascade

### 2. Invalid Path Format

**Scenario**: File uploaded without proper folder structure
**Behavior**: `storage.foldername(name)[1]` returns NULL or empty
**Result**: EXISTS check fails → ACCESS DENIED

### 3. Unauthenticated Requests

**Scenario**: User not logged in
**Behavior**: `auth.uid() IS NOT NULL` → FALSE
**Result**: ACCESS DENIED

### 4. Type Coercion

**Scenario**: Person.id is UUID/text, storage path is text
**Behavior**: Policies use `id::text` cast for compatibility
**Result**: Comparison works correctly

## Verification

### Policy Existence Check

```sql
SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'objects'
  AND policyname LIKE '%documents%'
ORDER BY cmd, policyname;
```

**Result**: 4 policies (DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE) ✅

### Real File Test

**File**: `f087d811-e0c6-4308-bda4-a47138cad662/1759581004914-Bildschirmfoto...png`
**PersonId**: `f087d811-e0c6-4308-bda4-a47138cad662`
**Person.ownerId**: `39595793-fb6f-46bc-99a7-420279f4db95`
**Policy Check**: ✅ ACCESS GRANTED for correct user

### Orphaned Files Test

**Files Found**: 3 personIds with no matching Person records
**Policy Check**: ✅ ACCESS DENIED (EXISTS returns FALSE)

## Integration Points

### Upload Endpoint (`/api/uploads`)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Line 47 in apps/web/src/app/api/uploads/route.ts
const storagePath = `${personId}/${Date.now()}-${fileName}`;

// Line 38-39: Authorization check
const person = await prisma.person.findUnique({ where: { id: personId } });
if (!person || person.ownerId !== userId) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'forbidden' }, { status: 403 });
}

// Line 50: Upload with service role (bypasses RLS)
const { error: upErr } = await admin.storage.from('documents').upload(storagePath, buffer, ...);
```

**Flow**:
1. User uploads file with `personId` parameter
2. API validates `person.ownerId === userId` (application-level auth)
3. API uses service role to upload file (bypasses RLS)
4. File stored at `{personId}/{timestamp}-{filename}`
5. When user later accesses file, RLS policies enforce ownership

### Signed URL Generation

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/storage.ts
export async function getSignedUrlForDocument(storagePath: string, expiresInSeconds = 3600) {
  const supabase = createClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!, // Service role
    { auth: { persistSession: false } }
  );

  const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
    .from('documents')
    .createSignedUrl(storagePath, expiresInSeconds);

  return { data, error };
}
```

**Flow**:
1. API endpoint calls `getSignedUrlForDocument()` with service role
2. Service role bypasses RLS to generate signed URL
3. Signed URL is returned to authenticated user
4. When user accesses signed URL, Supabase validates:
   - URL signature (cryptographic validation)
   - Expiration time (default 1 hour)
   - RLS policies (user's auth token from session)

**Important**: Service role is used to *generate* URLs, but user's auth token is validated when *accessing* the URL.

## Next Steps

### Immediate

1. ✅ **Verify in Application**: Test file upload and access in development environment
2. ✅ **Check 400 Errors Resolved**: Confirm signed URL access works without errors
3. ⏳ **Monitor Performance**: Watch for slow queries in Supabase logs

### Future Enhancements

1. **Cleanup Job**: Implement scheduled job to delete orphaned files (Person deleted but files remain)
2. **Audit Logging**: Add storage access logs to AnalyticsEvent table for security monitoring
3. **File Versioning**: Consider implementing version history in storage with RLS enforcement
4. **Shared Access**: If document sharing is needed, implement time-limited share policies
5. **Index Monitoring**: Monitor `Person_id_ownerId_idx` usage in production to confirm performance gains

## Troubleshooting

### 400 Errors Persisting

**Symptom**: Signed URLs still return 400 errors
**Diagnosis**:
1. Check if user has valid session with `auth.uid()`
2. Verify Person record exists for the personId in file path
3. Confirm `Person.ownerId` matches user's `auth.uid()`
4. Check Supabase logs for specific RLS denial reasons

**Fix**: Ensure application passes valid auth token when accessing signed URLs.

### Performance Issues

**Symptom**: Slow file access, high database CPU
**Diagnosis**: Check query plans for policy evaluation
**Fix**: Ensure `Person_id_ownerId_idx` index exists and is being used

### Policy Not Applied

**Symptom**: RLS policies don't seem to block access
**Diagnosis**: Service role bypasses RLS
**Fix**: Ensure client code uses authenticated user session, not service role
