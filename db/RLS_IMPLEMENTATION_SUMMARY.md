## Security Model

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
```
User (auth.uid)
  └─ Person (ownerId)
      ├─ Document (personId)
      │   ├─ Observation (personId, sourceDocId)
      │   └─ DocChunk (documentId)
      └─ SharePack (personId)
          ├─ SharePackItem (packId, documentId?, observationId?)
          └─ ShareEvent (packId)

ChatMessage (userId) - direct ownership
TokenUsage (userId) - read-only for users
AnalyticsEvent (userId) - read-only for users
```

### Access Patterns

1. **Server-Side API Routes** (Primary)
   - Use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - Bypass RLS (controlled access)
   - Verify ownership in application logic
   - Generate signed URLs for file access

2. **RLS Policies** (Defense-in-Depth)
   - Protect against misconfigured clients
   - Enforce multi-tenant isolation
   - Prevent horizontal privilege escalation
   - Support potential future client-side queries

3. **Storage Security**
   - Path-based isolation: `{personId}/{timestamp}_{filename}`
   - RLS policies on storage.objects table
   - Signed URLs with time-based expiration
   - Service role for server-side signed URL generation

## Key Security Features

### 1. Ownership Verification
Every RLS policy checks ownership through the chain:
```sql
-- Example: Document policy
EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM "Person" p
  WHERE p.id = "Document"."personId"
  AND p."ownerId" = auth.uid()::text
)
```

### 2. Storage Path Isolation
Storage policies use Supabase's `storage.foldername()` helper:
```sql
EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM "Person" p
  WHERE p.id = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  AND p."ownerId" = auth.uid()::text
)
```

### 3. Service Role Bypass
All tables have service role policies:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Service role has full access"
ON "TableName" FOR ALL
TO service_role
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);
```

### 4. Read-Only Tables
TokenUsage and AnalyticsEvent only allow SELECT for users:
```sql
-- Users can view their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own token usage"
ON "TokenUsage" FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid()::text = "userId");

-- Service role manages INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
```

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Storage Path Pattern
Your upload route uses `{personId}` NOT `{userId}`:
```typescript
const storagePath = `${personId}/${Date.now()}-${fileName}`;
```

This is CORRECT. The storage policy validates:
1. Extract `personId` from path (first folder)
2. Query Person table to verify ownership
3. Check if `Person.ownerId = auth.uid()`

DO NOT change this pattern without updating storage policies.

### Ownership Verification in API Routes
Always verify ownership before storage operations:
```typescript
const person = await prisma.person.findUnique({ where: { id: personId } });
if (!person || person.ownerId !== userId) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'forbidden' }, { status: 403 });
}
```

This is YOUR CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION and is CORRECT.

### Signed URL Expiration
Default: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
```typescript
export async function getSignedUrlForDocument(
  storagePath: string,
  expiresInSeconds = 3600
)
```

Recommendations:
- Preview: 5 minutes (300s)
- Viewing: 1 hour (3600s) - current default
- Download: 15 minutes (900s)
- SharePack: 24 hours (86400s)

## Deployment Order

1. **Staging First**
   - Deploy RLS policies
   - Run test suite
   - Verify application works
   - Test with real user flows
   - Monitor for 24-48 hours

2. **Production Second**
   - Create backup
   - Deploy during low-traffic window
   - Deploy same SQL script
   - Immediate verification
   - Monitor closely for first hour

## Verification Commands

### Check RLS Enabled
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

### Count Policies
```sql
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY tablename;
```

### Check Storage Bucket
```sql
SELECT id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types
FROM storage.buckets
WHERE id = 'documents';
```

### Test User Isolation
```sql
SET LOCAL role = authenticated;
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims.sub = 'user-uuid-here';
SELECT * FROM "Person"; -- Should only show user's persons
RESET role;
```

## Performance

### Indexes Created
All policy-filtered columns have indexes:
- `Person.ownerId`
- `Document.personId`
- `Observation.personId`
- `SharePack.personId`
- `SharePackItem.packId`
- `ShareEvent.packId`
- `DocChunk.documentId`
- `ChatMessage.userId`
- `TokenUsage.userId`
- `AnalyticsEvent.userId`

### Expected Overhead
- Direct ownership: <5ms overhead
- Single-level transitive: 5-10ms overhead
- Multi-level transitive: 10-15ms overhead

All negligible with proper indexes on production data volumes.

## Common Issues

### Issue: 403 Errors on all requests
**Cause:** Service role key not configured
**Fix:** Verify `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable

### Issue: Users can't see their own data
**Cause:** Policy logic error or auth.uid() not set
**Fix:** Test policy with manual `SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims.sub`

### Issue: Storage uploads fail
**Cause:** Path pattern mismatch
**Fix:** Verify path is `{personId}/{timestamp}_{filename}`

### Issue: Slow queries
**Cause:** Missing indexes
**Fix:** Run `CREATE INDEX` for policy-filtered columns
